      <u>Abstract</u>
      LPG gas is a great fuel alternative for the internal combustion car, 
      with a reduction of 12% in carbon emissions, as well as reducing nitrogen-based emission considerably, 
      which are more potent greenhouse gasses. LPG is not too difficult to source however it will take a lot of funding to integrate it into current transportation systems. 
      The UK government has invested around £1.1 billion into grafts to make purchasing, fuelling and using electric cars easier. 
      There are also plans to stop the sale of new petroleum-based cars in the UK by 2030. 
      <u>Introduction</u>
      Transportation emissions mainly arise from burning fossil fuels, where over 94% of the fuel is made of petroleum, 
      (Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 2024) these petroleum fuels are combusted and give off emissions that contain chemicals such as carbon dioxide, 
      methane and nitrous oxide. (Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 2024) These gases are released into the atmosphere, 
      contributing to air pollution, as well as posing major health risks if they happen to be inhaled over a large period of time, 
      some risks include cardiovascular diseases, respiratory system diseases, diseases in the nervous system, 
      the sensory organs as well as having the chance to increase the likelihood of developing mental disorders in a person, 
      according to Tatiana Germanova’s research profile (2017).  These fossil fuels produce these greenhouse gases when they combust, 
      leading to them trap heat in our atmosphere which increases the rate at which global warming happens. 
      It is estimated that there are 8.34 million deaths per year attributed to the effects of air pollution according to Jos Lelieveld (2023). 
      <u>Main strategies</u>
      One way to reduce emissions is through the substitution of regular pump petrol in the cars of public and government vehicles with Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). 
      Liquified Petroleum Gas is an alternative fuel that has been shown to reduce emissions, 
      emitting ‘12% less’ carbon dioxide than regular pump petrol. (The European LPG Association, no date) 
      Also LPG fuel has been shown to reduce nitrous oxide emissions: 
      ‘running on LPG were 120% to 180% better than petrol and 2000% better than diesel - In other words, one diesel vehicle emits the same quantities of NOx as over 20 LPG vehicles’ 
      (The European LPG Association, no date) as well as this; ‘On average, particle emissions from LPG-fuelled vehicles are 99% lower than diesel’ (The European LPG Association, no date).
      (NOx being shorthand for nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide). This is a very significant help to slow the effects of global warming given that nitrogen gases are more potent than carbon dioxide and have more of a negative impact on carbon dioxide. 
      This Liquified Petrol Gasoline fuel has great potential to be used at a large scale, 
      given that it is readily available and is not so limited given that; ‘LPG has substantial reserves due to its dual origins; 66% from gas field extraction 34% from crude oil refining’. 
      (The European LPG Association, no date) This alternate fuel has a large amount of upsides, 
      however there will be a large cost that will be attributed to allowing cars to use this new fuel. 
      The manufacturers will have to change their vehicle designs to suit this new fuel type, 
      which would likely be expensive and require a lot of man hours to change a large amount of critical features about their cars. 
      One way that manufacturers could be incentivised to make this change could be to reduce the taxes on the production or sale of these new cars, 
      which could likely improve the amount of LPG compatible cars that are on the road. 
      This new fuel type would also likely not have many downsides for the general public and would not require much adaptation from the people buying these new cars. 

      The UK government has also managed to impose many new policies and rules that have been helping tackle transportation emissions, 
      for example, the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be ended by the year 2030. (National Audit Office, 2021) 
      The government has also done a lot of funding to help people afford electric/lower emission cars. 
      So far they have spent ‘£1 billion on the plug-in car grant’ which helps to reduce the upfront cost of buying electric cars,
      they have spent ‘£97.2 million on grants to help people install charge-points at home’, they have spent 
      ‘£5.8 million to help local authorities install on-street residential charge-points' and also they have spent 
      ‘£9.5 million on a consumer awareness campaign’. (National Audit Office, 2021) The government has placed a lot of emphasis on making the general public only use electric cars. 
      These changes will likely be followed by even more bills that boost the sales of electric cars. 
      Seeing how the sale of electric cars is still a growing business with much more to be innovated and much more technology still to be developed which will reduce the entry point for people’s first electric cars, 
      emphasising the need to buy electric cars will likely lead to the quickest reduction in carbon emissions. 
      <u>Conclusion</u>
      There is still a growing incentive to invest in these plans to cut carbon emissions, 
      where the LPG could be used more in sectors of transportation such as sea travel, 
      where there is more demand for combustion engines, the technology might not have as much success as it would in the automobile industry, 
      given that the modern day household is moving closer and closer to only having an electric car. 
      Electric vehicles are surely going to be funded more and are going to play more of a role in our lives.
